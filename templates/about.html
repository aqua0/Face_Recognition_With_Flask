<h4>

The primary right of voting in the elections is the fundamental yardstick of a democratic citizen. 
During the modern era, the Electronic Voting machine (EVM) has been introduced which has marked a significant change in the conventional voting system in India replacing the ballot papers and boxes which were used earlier.
Building a secure voting system that offers privacy of conventional voting systems with proper voter authentication & transparency has been a challenge for a due course of time. 
Previously, the ballot papers used to consume a lot of time, due to the malpractices like booth-capturing and ballot-box stuffing, leading to more disputes and delayed results announcement. 
In this project, we propose a system which captures the facial image of a voter through a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based face recognizer, verifies it with the pre-captured images in the database, the result being positive, assumes the voter is a valid one, asks him to cast his vote for a political party.
After voting, the facial alignment of the voter gets deleted from the system, ensuring the voter will vote for only once.
